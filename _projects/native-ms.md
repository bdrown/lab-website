Proteins act as components of complex. Native protein mass spectrometry is a 
powerful technique that can provide important structural information about 
the stoichiometry and identity of complex components. Requirements in sample
preparation have limited the applicability of this approach to low-copy
endogenous protein complexes. Through precise manipulation of antibody
conjugation, we can liberate immunoprecipitated complexes under native
conditions.
