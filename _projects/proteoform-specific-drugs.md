Precision medicine is founded on the basis of therapies that selectively engage
proteins in diseased tissue while avoiding healthy tissue. This approach is most
powerfully demonstrated by drugs like imatinib and vemurafenib. These drugs
exploit changes in ligand binding sites that are modified by mutation. Although
undoubtedly successful, this approach does not fully exploit the differential
expression of proteoforms in disease states. We are developing improved methods
for measuring proteoform-specific interactions of small-molecule inhibitors and
exploring new chemical matter that can achieve selective inhibition.
