Proteoforms are the specific form of proteins after considering all possible
variations that can occur via gene mutation, alternative splicing, and
post-translational modification (PTM). These are the molecular entities that 
interact with other proteins and ligand, propagate signals, and ultimately 
carry out biological processes.

The widely practiced bottom-up approach (A) is a powerful technique for 
determining protein abundance. By digesting proteins into peptides, however,
linkage of individual modification sites is broken. Despite its strengths in
sensitivity and depth of protein coverage, the bottom-up approach struggles
to capture PTM stoichiometry and combination. The top-down approach, in which
intact proteins are ionized and then fragmented in the gas phase, can provide
the overall extent and location of modifications.
