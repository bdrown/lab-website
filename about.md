The Drown Research Group is a interdisciplinary team of scientists tackling challenging problems facing human health and disease. At the center of our work is a belief in the **_proteoform hypothesis_**: that proteoforms are more tightly linked to phenotype than any other biomolecule and therefore represent the richest source of discovery.

Students in the Drown lab get to learn through developing cutting edge projects and technologies.
